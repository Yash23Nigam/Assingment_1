In the first movie, I start right at the start of learning Python.
Lists (or arrays), variables, strings, and control lines were some of the things we talked about.
Having already learned languages like C and Java, which aren't as easy for beginners, helped me learn this one quickly.
I liked how flexible and easy it was to handle data with Python.
Libraries made writing code easier by getting rid of the need to start from scratch.
This was shown in the first project, which used tools to make it easy to change the data in an Excel file.
The machine learning project also had tools that were already made to save time.
Since I know more about HTML, CSS, and JS, the Django project was a bigger task for me. But I'm sure that I'll get used to working in the system quickly.
